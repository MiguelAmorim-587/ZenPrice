# zenPricePI

This work was developed in partnership with the company Ritain.io and ieeta, under the project zenPriceâ„¢ - Competitive intelligence SaaS, based on time series with the evolution of the price of a given product during a certain period of time, where the daily price is read and stored in an information repository.
